<p>I am currently working as CTO of CIAYO Corp. Previously as UX head, Assistant to Product Development Manager. I am also one of the Co Founder of PT Dragon Capital Centre, the company behind CIAYO Corp.</p>
<h2 id="the-site-">The site</h2>
<p>This site is build using [Hugo] (<a href="https://gohugo.io),">https://gohugo.io),</a> and [Call me Sam] (<a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-sam/">https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-sam/</a>) theme. This site is designed to be fast, thus static content without bulky features is the key feature of this site. I plan to carefully add several features to enhance the UX of this site, but as per now [Call me Sam] (<a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-sam/">https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-sam/</a>) at its default config is adequate.</p>
<h2 id="more-about-the-content-">More about the content</h2>
<p>This site host 3 types of content, thus you'll only be facing 3 huge links in the main screen. The main reason why [Call me Sam] (<a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-sam/">https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-sam/</a>) was selected is because it fits most of the criteria that I have set upon building this site. There are 3 criteria that need to be fulfilled: \</p>
<ol>
<li>Easy to Navigate</li>
<li>Easy to Use</li>
<li>Easy on Eyes</li>
</ol>
<p>There are couple things from [Call me Sam] (<a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-sam/">https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-sam/</a>) which may hurt criteria #1 and #2. The first drawback is that in [Call me Sam] (<a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-sam/),">https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-sam/),</a> the navigation in <code>single page</code> layout is located in the footer which is kinda unusual for most website navigation, but I'm pretty sure it's not a deal breaker as I can modify the navigation later. The second drawback is that the theme do not have search function which is actually kinda unimportant features for a site like this, but I plan to add the search function when the size of the site expand.</p>
