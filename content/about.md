Hello, I'm Erick. classified as generalist species. 

I am currently working as CTO of CIAYO Corp. Previously as UX head, Assistant to Product Development Manager. I am also one of the Co Founder of PT Dragon Capital Centre, the company behind CIAYO Corp.

## The site ##

This site is build using [Hugo] (https://gohugo.io), and [Call me Sam] (https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-sam/) theme. This site is designed to be fast, thus static content without bulky features is the key feature of this site. I plan to carefully add several features to enhance the UX of this site, but as per now [Call me Sam] (https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-sam/) at its default config is adequate.

## More about the content ##

This site host 3 types of content, thus you'll only be facing 3 huge links in the main screen. The main reason why [Call me Sam] (https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-sam/) was selected is because it fits most of the criteria that I have set upon building this site. There are 3 criteria that need to be fulfilled: \

1. Easy to Navigate 
2. Easy to Use
3. Easy on Eyes

There are couple things from [Call me Sam] (https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-sam/) which may hurt criteria #1 and #2. The first drawback is that in [Call me Sam] (https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-sam/), the navigation in `single page` layout is located in the footer which is kinda unusual for most website navigation, but I'm pretty sure it's not a deal breaker as I can modify the navigation later. The second drawback is that the theme do not have search function which is actually kinda unimportant features for a site like this, but I plan to add the search function when the size of the site expand.
