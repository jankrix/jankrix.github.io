    <p>Everyone has their own style of mentoring. At least that is what I believe recently, however what does mentoring really mean? You could look at dozen of articles, etimology or people's opinion regarding the meaning of mentoring. For me, mentoring is all about preparing a suitable person to embark their own journey, a greater one. In my definition there are at least several phase involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encounter</li>
<li>Motivate</li>
<li>Nurture</li>
<li>Protect</li>
<li>Graduate</li>
</ul>
<p>What does suitable person mean? for someone to be able to receive information and process it you had to look for person's character for compatibility with you as a mentor. Each person should be equiped with such unconcious level of mindset which will help them when they encounter problem, at some point a stoic person is needed, at another one a person with empathy is required. The compatibility is really depend on which area that you as mentor is most comfortable with.</p>
<p>Why does mentoring matter? it's actually does not. While I see mentoring as something that everyone with greater experience should do, it's compeletely a personal choice for someone to contribute to their own community. The caveat here is to keep your pride in raising such a great talent to yourself and not to boast yourself. You need to be understand that just because you have greater experience, it never means that you are far more superior than those who lack of experience. New generation will always born and we have the responsibility (it is 100% up to you whether you want to take those responsibility or not) to help them grow and if possible outgrow you. How your pertege respect you is their own matter and you need to keep yourself humble not to overcredit yourself.</p>
<h2 id="encounter-">ENCOUNTER</h2>
<p>A meeting could happen by accident, or depend on how keen you are, you could embark your own journey to find one. For me, all the mentoring lifecycle happen in accident. There are one times when I forced this process in mentoring someone which unfortunately reverse the process to negative mentoring phase (my own term). Negative Mentoring happen when you succesfully transform a person into a better one with a hint or tremendous negative relationship. Someone might want to become better than you because they hate they way you do things or they have dislikeness towards you.</p>
<p>Negative mentoring could be a really huge success but it does sacrifices your own emotion, reputation and impression although the end result are the same; Preparing someone to become a much better person for their own journey.</p>
<p>Find someone that fits your personality, having the correct basic mindset and a character you desire. This will increase the chance of success.</p>
